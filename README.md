This is the home of the non-profit organization that will run [liberapay.com]
(http://liberapay.com/) if I can find someone to cofound it with me.

The proposed bylaws and rules of procedure are in [this pull request]
(https://github.com/liberapay/liberapay.org/pull/1).

As stated in the proposed rules or procedure, all discussions and decisions
regarding the organization will happen by exchanging text messages through the
Internet. I propose that we use GitHub's issues tracker for that, which is
essentially the same as using a mailing list, except with a nicer web UI and
per-thread (un)subscription. You should [subscribe to all discussions]
(https://github.com/liberapay/liberapay.org/subscription) and make sure to
[enable email notifications](https://github.com/settings/notifications).

The technical aspects of running the Liberapay service are discussed separately
in the [liberapay.com repository](https://github.com/liberapay/liberapay.com).
