This is the home of the non-profit organization that runs [liberapay.com]
(https://liberapay.com/).

The current bylaws and rules of procedure are in [the en/ directory]
(https://github.com/liberapay/liberapay.org/tree/master/en). The official
French versions are in the [the fr/ directory]
(https://github.com/liberapay/liberapay.org/tree/master/fr).

The current legal representative is [Changaco](https://github.com/Changaco/)
([elected on Dec 19, 2015][1]).

As stated in the rules of procedure, all discussions and decisions regarding
the organization happen by exchanging text messages through the Internet.
Right now we use GitHub's issues tracker for that, which is essentially the
same as using a mailing list, except with a nicer web UI and per-thread
(un)subscription. You should [subscribe to all discussions]
(https://github.com/liberapay/liberapay.org/subscription) and make sure to
[enable email notifications](https://github.com/settings/notifications).
